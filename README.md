# Text Generator
The website asks for the name of a music artist and uses the Genius Lyrics API to get their lyrics.
Text is then generated from these lyrics using Markov chains and is displayed on a new webpage along with the artist's image gotten using the spotify API. 

I used a wrapper for the genius lyrics api called lyricsgenius. It was developed by @johnwmillr
